## Ingredients

| Qty | Item |
| --------- | ---- |
| 1 lb | lean Meat, beef, chicken, pork, turkey or any other lean meat. <br/> Can Be Ground, chopped sliced or cut into small bite size pieces. |
| 1 | Small Onion, chopped |
| 1 can | (15 Oz) of Stewed Tomatoes, plain or any flavor |
| 1 can | ( 15 Oz) of Beans, any type except "baked" |
| 1 Tbsp | Minced Garlic or 2 Whole Cloves |
| 2 Tbsp | Real Maple Syrup |
| Â¼ cup | Any Type Salsa. Fresh Is Better.
| - | Ms. Dash, to taste |
| - | Olive Oil |

> Note:
> If You Use Chili Flavored Stewed Tomatoes, be careful to taste chili before adding the salsa.
> Beware That Hot Salsa Will Add Additional Heat To The Already Spicy Tomatoes.

## Directions
- In a medium sauce pan or large skillet, Saute onions over medium high heat until transparent in a small amount of olive oil. I use a medium size cast iron pot or my large cast iron skillet.
- Add meat and cook until meat is done but do not over cook. Drizzle more olive oil if needed to keep meat from sticking.
- After meat is cooked, add tomatoes, garlic, beans (with juices), and salsa to taste. Mix well.
- Sprinkle with Mrs. Dash to taste.
- Add Maple syrup. The amount can vary depending on sweetness wanted.
- Heat slowly over low to medium until beans are heated through. Do not boil or over cook.
- Serve with corn chips, oyster crackers, or favorite cornbread. Chili can be garnished with a variety of items such as grated cheddar cheese, sour cream, jalapeno slices, or crispy onions. Use your imagination and anything that you have in your cupboard that you enjoy with stews or soups.

## My Notes
- I usually double the recipe
- You can never add too much maple syrup
